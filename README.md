First of all, I'm still (28 Dec 2017) a beginner programmer and there is a lot to learn. but here, You will see the challenges I coped with while I was learning Python. These challenges are not rated by difficulty or etc; but when you see the Soloutions, you will understand their simplicity. 

If you have better ideas or challenges in your mind, feel free to help me. :)

# no. 1 ) Factorial
write a function which calculates the factorial of a given number. (you can't use math library.)

that simple! try using recursion for solving this problem. 

*(in case you don't remember, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24) 


# no. 2 ) Simple Text analyzer
write a program which tells us the number of upper case, lower case and numbers and other characters in it. 
(Using lists is the best way to solve this challenge. don't use built-in functions such as upper(), lower(). )

try to make the output more beautiful using formatters.
